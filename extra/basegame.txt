1-Styling & Animation

    Create a Styles class with ANSI escape codes for colors, bold, and clearing lines. 👍

    Use simple “spinner” or “typing” animations when generating encounters, attacking, or opening chests. 👍 

2-Maintain a game dictionary in memory with keys:

{
  "level": int,            # current dungeon level
  "hp": int,               # player health
  "max_hp": int,           # maximum health
  "gold": int,             # currency
  "inventory": [],         # list of item names
  "weapons": [],           # list of weapon names
  "artifacts": [],         # list of unique artifacts
  "cheat_mode": bool,      # unlocked by secret code file
}

👍

On exit, prompt to save progress to JSON (using json + os + sys). 👍 (make overwrite feature later maybe)

On start, allow loading from an existing save file. 👍


3- Random Encounters 👍
    Each level triggers one of:

        Monster Fight (79%): random monster with name, HP, reward gold. 

        Treasure Chest (20%): random gold amount or random item drop.

        Shopkeeper (Extra buffed with insane items) (1%): opportunity to buy potions/tools before proceeding. 👍

4- Battle System - one feature left 👍

    When fighting:

    Display monster name and HP.

    Loop: Hero attack → Monster attack (with spinner).

    Damage is random within weapon's damage range.

    If hero HP drops to 0 → Game Over.

    If monster dies → award gold, maybe drop an item.

5- Inventory & Equipment 👍

    Equip one weapon at a time from weapons list.

    Weapons have a name and damage range stored in parallel lists (no dicts!).

    Potions in inventory can heal a fixed amount when used. 

6- Shop System 👍

    Accessible via “shop” command.

    Items to purchase (with prices):

    Small Health Potion - restores 20HP

    Iron Sword - adds to weapons (damage 5-10)

    Magic Scroll - grants temporary attack buff

    Secret Map - reveals next level's danger (chance to avoid monsters)

    Deduct gold and add items/weapons to lists.

7- Level Progression 
    Buy a level up from shop. 👍


8- Cheat Mode 👍
    If a file named invincibility.txt exists, automatically unlock a hidden command cheat allowing you to set any game parameter (HP, gold, level).

9- Commands and Help 👍
    explore (or e) - descend to the next level and trigger encounter

    status (or s) - show current HP, level, gold, inventory, equipped weapon

    shop (or sh) - open the shop

    use ( or u) - use a potion or scroll from inventory

10 - Victory & Defeat 👍

    Victory: Reaching Level-11 (having cleared Level-10) and defeating the Dragon Lord grants the “Drago's Egg” artifact and ends the game.

    Defeat: Hero HP drops to 0 → show “Game Over” you have to make press play again.

11 - One line Logic (OLL)

    Must do this 👍
