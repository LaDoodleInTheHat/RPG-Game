Oh! 

hello adventurer! 

what brings you here today?

<treasure>, <experience points>

sweet!

well, I'm Noah, this game's alpha tester, and I came here on a quest with my friend Krivi, but we got split up. 

do you know krvi?

(y/n)

(y)

ah, I see.

well you probably already know that he lost his hat. can you go bring it back to him? 

\[+1 hat]

Thanks!

come back to me when you give it to him.

(n)

well krivi's the creator of this game, so he's basically god.

He dropped his hat when we split up.

can you give it back to him?

\[+1 hat]

great, come back when you give it back.

oh.

you can't find him, can you? 

well, here's a map.

\[+1 doodle map]

go use it to find him.

{this text will appear no matter what option the player has selected}

so, while you're here, would you like to do some shopping?

(y/n)

(y)

great, here's what I have in store.

cube sword - 350 gold

defensive shield - 300 gold

magic scroll - 100 gold

mysterious trinket - 50 gold

weapon stats: 

cube sword \[200, 450]

defensive shield \[25, 40] (makes counters have a greater chance to succeed, and reduces damage by X amount)

purchase cube sword: this is my greatest weapon, please take care of it.

cannot afford cube sword: dude. you need some more money before I can give this to you. 

purchase defensive shield: not sure if you'd call this a weapon, but it will definitely help in reducing the power of those blows!

cannot afford shield: hah! guess you're too broke for defense.

purchase magic scroll: I got much better prices than that shopkeeper guy.

cannot afford magic scroll: dude this is literally the cheaper version of the original??? uhh, just go get some more gold.

purchase mysterious trinket: no idea what this is, maybe krivi would know...

cannot afford mysterious trinket: DUDE IT'S 50 GOLD!!!!! HOW CAN YOU NOT AFFORD THIS???? just pay
