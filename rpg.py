1-Styling & Animation

    Create a Styles class with ANSI escape codes for colors, bold, and clearing lines. üëç

    Use simple ‚Äúspinner‚Äù or ‚Äútyping‚Äù animations when generating encounters, attacking, or opening chests. üëç 

2-Maintain a game dictionary in memory with keys:

{
  "level": int,            # current dungeon level
  "hp": int,               # player health
  "max_hp": int,           # maximum health
  "gold": int,             # currency
  "inventory": [],         # list of item names
  "weapons": [],           # list of weapon names
  "artifacts": [],         # list of unique artifacts
  "cheat_mode": bool,      # unlocked by secret code file
}

üëç

On exit, prompt to save progress to JSON (using json + os + sys). üëç

On start, allow loading from an existing save file. üëç


3- Random Encounters
    Each level triggers one of:

        Monster Fight (70%): random monster with name, HP, reward gold.

        Treasure Chest (20%): random gold amount or random item drop.

        Shopkeeper (10%): opportunity to buy potions/tools before proceeding.

4- Battle System

    When fighting:

    Display monster name and HP.

    Loop: Hero attack ‚Üí Monster attack (with spinner).

    Damage is random within weapon's damage range.

    If hero HP drops to 0 ‚Üí Game Over.

    If monster dies ‚Üí award gold, maybe drop an item.

5- Inventory & Equipment

    Equip one weapon at a time from weapons list.

    Weapons have a name and damage range stored in parallel lists (no dicts!).

    Potions in inventory can heal a fixed amount when used.

6- Shop System

    Accessible between levels or via secret ‚Äúshop‚Äù command.

    Items to purchase (with prices):

    Small Health Potion - restores 20HP

    Iron Sword - adds to weapons (damage 5-10)

    Magic Scroll - grants temporary attack buff

    Secret Map - reveals next level's danger (chance to avoid monsters)

    Deduct gold and add items/weapons to lists.

7- Level Progression
    Clearing a level increases level by 1.

    On odd levels, increase monster difficulty; on even levels, offer treasure rooms.


8- Cheat Mode
    If a file named invincibility.txt exists, automatically unlock a hidden command cheat allowing you to set any game parameter (HP, gold, level).

9- Commands and Help
    explore (or e) - descend to the next level and trigger encounter

    status (or s) - show current HP, level, gold, inventory, equipped weapon

    shop (or sh) - open the shop

    use ( or u) - use a potion or scroll from inventory

    equip (or eq) - equip a weapon from your arsenal

    save - force save game to JSON

    load - load from existing save file

    help (or h) - list all commands

    quit - exit (prompt to save)

10 - Victory & Defeat

    Victory: Reaching Level-11 (having cleared Level-10) and defeating the Dragon Lord grants the ‚ÄúDrago's Egg‚Äù artifact and ends the game.

    Defeat: Hero HP drops to 0 ‚Üí show ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù you have to make press play again.
