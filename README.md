# RPG Game

It's a good game, :)

You use a command line to explore somewhere, and level up, here are the commands:

 - explore (or e) - descend to the next level and trigger encounter
 - status (or s) - show current HP, level, gold, inventory, equipped weapon
 - shop (or sh) - open the shop
 - use ( or u) - use a potion or scroll from inventory
 - equip (or eq) - equip a weapon from your arsenal
 - save - force save game to JSON
 - load - load from existing save file
 - help (or h) - list all commands
 - quit (or q) to prompt save and exit
 - autosave (or a) to toggle autosave

Try it by running `rpg-beta-0.3.1.exe`

Also you kinda need python (prefereably the latest version) and it needs to be a path variable. :)
